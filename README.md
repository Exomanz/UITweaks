# UITweaks
A Beat Saber mod that aims to bring more color to the in-game HUD!

## Dependencies:
- BSIPA v4.3.0+
- SiraUtil v3.1.3+
- BeatSaberMarkupLanguage v1.7.6+

## Features
- Multiplier ring colors, as well as an option to smoothly transition between them and a rainbow animation on 8x.
- Energy bar colors corresponding to your available energy, and an optional rainbow animation on full.
- Combo FC line colors, including optional gradient lines.
- Progress bar colors for the fill amount, background and slider. There is also an option to transition between 2 colors as the song progresses.
- Multiplayer player position panel colors for each position, an option to hide the first place animation, and an option for the static panel to use a static color.
  - These features broke with SiraUtil v3. I will fix this at some point.
- Additional options to re-italicize some UI elements.
